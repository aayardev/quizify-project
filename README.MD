- Frontend: The frontend was developed using TypeScript, Next.js (SSR, CSR), React Query, and Tailwind CSS to create an interactive and user-friendly interface.
- Authentication: NextAuth was implemented to handle user authentication.
- Artificial Intelligence Integration: The OpenAI API was integrated to generate multiple-choice questions.
- Version Control: Git and GitHub were used for version control.
- Containerization: Docker was employed to encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring maximum portability and reproducibility in different environments.
